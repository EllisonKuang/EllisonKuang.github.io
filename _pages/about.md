Hi, I'm Haowei Kuang(匡浩玮). I'm currently a Ph.D student at [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes image/video compression and enhancement. I’m honored to study under the supervison of [Prof. Zongming Guo](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/vip/yjscy/jzg/234256.htm) and [Jiaying Liu](http://39.96.165.147/people/liujiaying.html). Prior to that, I served as research assistant under the supervison of [Prof. Jiang Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuj&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/) and achieved my Bachelor degree in Computer Science at [SUSTech](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shiqi Yu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=yusq&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1).
